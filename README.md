# idasen-desk-core

This repository is about controlling Ikea's Idasen Desk using Windows 10 and BluetoothLE. Ikea only provides an Android and IOs app to control the desk. I thought it would be far more convenient to control the desk using a Windows 10 system tray application. This repository contains all the low level code to detect and control the desk. The code is build into a NuGet package and is currently used by:
- [idasen-desk](https://github.com/tschroedter/idasen-desk)
- [idasen-desk-rest-api](https://github.com/tschroedter/idasen-desk-rest-api)
